# Markdown_Reader
## Very much a work in process

* Goal is to better learn Python and GUI development via having an auto-updating markdown reader and editor

### To-Do
* Add File tree navigation
* Display html view in window alongside edits
* May or may not keep the browser and have it be a 'study environment' type system
